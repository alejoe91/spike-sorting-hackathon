## Dates and Location

- **Pre-hackathon project pitch session:** TBD
- **Dates:** June 6 - 10
- **Location:** Flatiron Institute, 162 5th Ave, New York, NY 10010

## Overview

This event aims to bring together spike sorting developers and experts to tackle open and unsolved spike sorting 
issues and to move the spike sorting field forward in an open and highly collaborative fashion.

Given the fast-paced and constantly evolving neurotechnology that is becoming increasingly available to 
neuroscientists across the globe, we believe that the spike sorting community should join forces to find 
novel and scalable solutions for fully reproducible and accurate spike sorting in the years to come.

In light of the recent efforts for standardization and unification of spike sorting software (especially with the 
[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and 
[SpikeForest](https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/) projects), this hackaton is expected to provide a 
tangible contribution to the electrophysiology field to make new and integrate existing tools for the community.

## Registration

The event will be in a hybrid format. We have reached capacity for on-site participants, but anyone is welcome to join remotely.

Please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDq6xN5panK_bTCypUDw5gbXmJosWkSlRJA5Rb8-Lnyq6HBA/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we can send you announcements about the event.

## Projects

We will be organizing our goals for the hackathon around Projects, which can be submitted to this website via GitHub. 
All participants are encouraged to start a new project or join an existing project. For questions, discussions, and ideas,
do not hesitate to open issues on the event [GitHub page](https://github.com/catalystneuro/spike-sorting-hackathon)
