## What should my hackathon project look like?

  1. You can make significant progress during the hackathon (i.e., in ~5 days). This also means that you should come prepared for the hackathon (e.g., be ready to read any data you need for your project)
  1. The project would benefit from collaboration with others at the hackathon

### Does everyone need to have their own project?

Everyone should be part of a project, but not everyone must have their own project. Hacking in teams is fun!

## How to create a new project

When you are ready, create a new project by creating a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder of the [projects](.) folder using the provided [project template][template/] and add your project to the project list in the [index.md](../index.md) file. Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project using GitHub are:

1. Open [project template][template/README.md] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to the [projects](https://github.com/catalystneuro/spike-sorting-hackathon/main/projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Add a link to your project to the "Projects" section in the project list of [projects](index.md#list-of-projects)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
