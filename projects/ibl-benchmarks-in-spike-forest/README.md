# How to compare spike sorting runs with no ground-truth - Upload IBL benchmarks datasets in Spike Forest

## Key Investigators

## Project Description
We have a set of 4 Neuropixel benchmark datasets that we use at IBL to compare spike sorting algorithms and parametrization in different brain regions.
It may be a good thing to share those 4 datasets more broadly, possibly in spike forest for others to use them as benchmarks.
There is no ground truth for this data.

## Objectives
The objectives are 2-fold: get the IBL people acquainted with spike forest by contributing datasets, and a larger objective that is to try define metrics for spike sorting runs when no reference / ground truth is available.

## Approach and Plan
1)  See if it is desirable to upload those datasets on spike forest, if yes, do it.
2)  Run a few sorters on those datasets (otherwise there are already some results available from IBL)
3)  Devise some functions / code to compare and assess the quality of the runs.
